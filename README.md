pandas: Pandas is a software library written for the Python for data manipulation and analysis. It is a tool used to handle and analyze large datasets, and it is particularly useful for data wrangling and preparation, as well as for performing statistical analysis and data visualization.

matplotlib.pyplot is a 2D plotting library for the Python programming language. It provides a wide range of functions for creating and customizing a variety of plots and charts, including line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, error bars, and many others

numpy: NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It is particularly useful for working with large arrays and matrices of data, and it provides many functions for performing operations on these data structures efficiently. 

seaborn: is a data visualization library in Python that is built on top of Matplotlib and is designed to provide a higher-level interface for creating statistical graphics and visualizing statistical models.

The Motivation behind this Data Analysis is to answer the following 4 Key Research Questions:
1. Which year had the most incidents?
2. Which state had the most incidents?
3. Which state had the least amount of deaths?
4. which day of the month did the most incidents occur?

I am looking to see when and where Gun Voilence is at its highest in the united states. As we all know The United States has a very high rate of gun violence compared to other developed countries and it is a constant topic of debate. 

The results of my data show that between the years 2013-2018 Gun Violence was at its highest. The data shows that California had the most amount of deaths out of all the states throughout the years 2013–2018. California had over 5,000 deaths total. The lowest include Rhode Island and Hawaii. Which both had significantly less than 1,000 deaths. I also looked atthe number of deaths vs casualties in each state and found that the states that had both the lowest casualties and injuries were Vermont, North Dakota and Maine. Illinois has a the highest number of injuries but not the highest number of deaths. In turn, Texas has nearly the same amount of deaths as injuries. Lastly, my results show that in the beginning of the month there’s a peak in Gun Violence and there is a steep decline towards the end of the month and a stabalization throughout the middle of the month.
